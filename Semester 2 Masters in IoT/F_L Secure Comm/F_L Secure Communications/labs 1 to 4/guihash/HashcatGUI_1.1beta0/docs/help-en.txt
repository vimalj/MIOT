Built-in charsets:

?l = abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
?u = ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
?d = 0123456789
?s =  !"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~
?a = ?l?u?d?s
?h = 8 bit characters from 0xc0 - 0xff
?D = 8 bit characters from german alphabet
?F = 8 bit characters from french alphabet
?R = 8 bit characters from russian alphabet

Output file commands
-----------------------------------------

You can use certain commands in the file output so it auto-generates the output filenames. Here is the 3 you can use:

[HashType] - This simply inserts the HashType number from hashcat.
[m] - This simply inserts the HashType number from hashcat.
[Mode] - This simply inserts the Mode number from hashcat.
[a] - This simply inserts the Mode number from hashcat.
e.g.
Output: C:\found_[HashType].txt
with mode MD5
Actual: C:\found_0.txt

[InFile] - This simply inserts the entire input filepath.
e.g.
Hash file: C:\md5_hashes.txt
Output: [InFile].out
Actual: C:\md5_hashes.txt.out

[InFilename] - This simply inserts the filename from the hash file without the file extension. In the example below, the clipboard was used, hence the tmp file.
e.g.
Hash file: C:\Users\Owner\AppData\Local\Temp\tmpD2C6.tmp
Output: C:\[InFilename]_found.txt
Actual: C:\tmpD2C6_found.txt

[InFilenameExt] - This simply inserts the filename from the hash file with the file extension. In the example below, the clipboard was used, hence the tmp file.
e.g.
Hash file: C:\Users\Owner\AppData\Local\Temp\tmpD2C6.tmp
Output: C:\[InFilenameExt].out
Actual: C:\tmpD2C6.txt.out

-----------------------------------------
Markov
-----------------------------------------

When using this dropdown, use 0 for normal / classic brute-force attack. Changing this value depends on the charset your brute-forcing. Here are some examples below:

Mask Used: ?d?l
Charset Length: 36
Markov Range: 1 to 36
Best Markov number based on time and success rate: 22

Mask Used: ?d?l?u
Charset Length: 62
Markov Range: 1 to 62
Best Markov number based on time and success rate: 40

Mask Used: ?d?l?u?s OR ?a
Charset Length: 95
Markov Range: 1 to 95
Best Markov number based on time and success rate: 62

You can change these number as you feel necessary, higher mean more success BUT slower, lower means it's faster but has less success rate.
