LCD Lab Exercises (prep for LCD CA)
Interfacing an LCD

In all the following step refer carefully to the LCD article on moodle for the pin-out of the LCD.  Please ensure you do not confuse your power and ground pins.

You can also use the LCD simulator linked from moodle to test sending commands and data to the LCD.

To help with this PLEASE use the RED lines on your breadboard for power and the BLUE lines for ground.



Exercise 1: Connecting power ground and contrast.

Connect the power and ground rails to the arduino power and ground.
Connect the Vss and Vcc pins of the LCD as shown.
Connect the variable resistor (pot) as shown.
Here is a diagram of the setup required.

You can now test that your LCD is powering up correctly etc by twisting the pot left and right.
What you will see is the first row of characters go dark and then light as you twist.
What you are doing here is adjusting the contrast of the display.
To correctly adjust the contrast twist the pot until all the character blocks go black.
Next slowly twist back in the opposite direction until the black blocks just disappear.

Exercise 2: Experiment with the Simulator.

Follow the link to the LCD Simulator on moodle and experiment with the interface until you understand how it works.  Read the LCA Article 1 document to gain a better understanding or look at one of the many online tutorials.
